# React Next Google Tools

A lightweight, easy-to-use library for integrating Google Analytics into both **React** and **Next.js** applications. No complex configurations‚Äîjust plug it in, provide your Measurement ID, and start tracking page views!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Universal Support:** Works seamlessly with **Next.js** and standard **React** projects.
- **Simple Integration:** Initialize Google Analytics with a single component.
- **Zero Config Bloat:** Just pass your Measurement ID. No extensive setup required.
- **TypeScript Ready:** Comes with type definitions for a smooth developer experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

`npm install react-next-google-tools`
or
`yarn add react-next-google-tools`

### Usage with Next.js

To integrate with Next.js, simply add the component to your `_app.tsx` or `_app.js` file. Ensure you‚Äôre using the `GoogleAnalytics` component inside your main layout or `_app` file, so it initializes across all pages.
```bash
// pages/_app.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { GoogleAnalytics } from 'react-next-google-tools';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && (
        <GoogleAnalytics id="G-XXXXXXXXXX" isNextJs />
      )}
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
**Note:** Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Google Analytics Measurement ID.

### Usage with React

For React projects (e.g., CRA, Vite, or other build systems):

```bash 
// src/App.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { GoogleAnalytics } from 'react-next-google-tools';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <GoogleAnalytics id="G-XXXXXXXXXX" isNextJs={false} />
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
## üîß Props

-   **`id` (string, required):**  
    Your Google Analytics Measurement ID (e.g., `G-ABC123XYZ`).
    
-   **`isNextJs` (boolean, optional):**  
    Defaults to `true`. If you‚Äôre using React without Next.js, set this to `false`.  
    This determines how the analytics script is injected. Next.js uses `next/script`, while pure React falls back to a standard `<script>` tag.
